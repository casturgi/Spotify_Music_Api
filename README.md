This app was created with create-react-app. I suggest reading their documentation for more information about using this repo. 

After cloning this repo, run npm install. 

For this application to function properly, you'll need to get a spotify token and replace the authorization header in the app.js file on line 24. Make sure that the token you get from authenting with spotify is preceeded by the string "Bearer ". 

To get the spotify auth token, follow the instructions detailed in this link http://www.angular-city.com/2017/07/spotify-web-api-access.html.
